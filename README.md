Death predictorüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: USELESS


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Rifa vp - Farook college

### Project Description
Death Predictor is a fun and spooky web app that playfully 'predicts' your cause and date of death based on your name and birthdate. With humorous scenarios, interactive animations, and a personalized death certificate, it‚Äôs designed purely for entertainment and laughter. Share your doom with friends on social media and enjoy the creepy-cool experience!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People just don‚Äôt know when or how they‚Äôll meet their ultimate doom ‚Äî and it‚Äôs making their lives far too predictable and boring. Life without a dramatic, glitter-filled banana‚Äëpeel slip just feels incomplete.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter Death Predictor: a hilariously creepy web app that calculates your final day and serves up a ridiculous cause of death ‚Äî from hugging a cactus to overdosing on Kerala parottas. You even get a stylish, totally non‚Äëlegal death certificate to share with friends and¬†freak¬†them¬†out!
